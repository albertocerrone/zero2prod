# Rust Email Newsletter API - My Learning Journey
This repository is a collection of code snippets and projects that I am working on while reading the book "Zero to Production in Rust: An introduction to backend development." The book teaches how to build a fully functional email newsletter API from scratch, and this repository is my personal learning journey as I implement and improve upon the concepts presented in the book.

## Overview
The email newsletter API that I am building will allow users to subscribe, unsubscribe, and receive newsletters via email. Along the way, the book covers various topics such as:

* Leveraging Rust's crates ecosystem
* Structuring applications to make them modular and extensible
* Writing tests from single units to full-blown integration tests
* Enforcing domain invariants using Rust's type system
* Implementing a robust error handling strategy
* Authenticating and authorizing users of an API
* Observing the state of applications using structured logs
* Setting up an extensive continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for Rust projects
* Contents
* This repository contains code snippets and projects that I have implemented while learning from the book. Each project is organized in its own directory and comes with its own README file that explains its purpose and functionality.

## Usage
To use this repository, simply clone it and navigate to the project of your choice. Follow the instructions in the README file to build, run, and test the project. All code comes attached to the book, tests included.
